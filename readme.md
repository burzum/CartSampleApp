This is a sample application for the CakePHP Cart plugin.

http://github.com/burzum/Cart

## Setup

	git clone git://github.com/burzum/CartSampleApp.git
	cd CartSampleApp
	git submodule update --init
	cd app
	migrations.bat 

On *nix systems run migrations.sh instead of .bat

It will create an user for you, you can login with admin@sampleapp.com and the password is "password". There will be a few items to play with.

The plugin is also implementing a dummy checkout process.
